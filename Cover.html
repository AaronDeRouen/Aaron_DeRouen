    <h3>My Intended Major</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</li>
        <li>2022 Projected Graduation</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Experience Summary</h3>
    <p>My current and past work experience has been in the oil and gas field. I have worked within the lab community
        analyzing results for the process units. I have worked in the field as a process operator, trouble shooting unit
        issues, working as a team to create an inclusive work enviroment, along with the goal of making quality products
        for our customers. My next goal is to become a Web Developer working internationally in Japan.</p>

    <h3>My Preceived Calling</h3>
    <p>My career change into the field of Web Development could be an opportunity for me to reach out world wide and
        spread Gods message through my web pages. Creating Godly sites that can expose people to the truth and the light
        of Jesus Christ. I could be their resource by creating a site that allows someone to quickly search bible versus
        and also read daily devotions. Bibles aren't always readily avaliable but smart phones are and in today's world
        searching a website is faster than flipping through a Bible.</p>
