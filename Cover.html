        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</li>

        <h3><u class="underline">Experience Summary</u></h3>
        <br>
        <p>My current and past work experience has been in the oil and gas field. I have worked within the lab
            community
            analyzing results for the process units. I have worked in the field as a process operator, trouble
            shooting
            unit
            issues, working as a team to create an inclusive work enviroment, along with the goal of making quality
            products
            for our customers. My next goal is to become a Web Developer working internationally in Japan.</p>
<br>
        <h3><u class="underline">My Preceived Calling</u></h3>
        <br>
        <p>My career change into the field of Web Development could be an opportunity for me to reach out world wide
            and
            spread Gods message through my web pages. Creating Godly sites that can expose people to the truth and
            the
            light
            of Jesus Christ. I could be their resource by creating a site that allows someone to quickly search
            bible
            versus
            and also read daily devotions. Bibles aren't always readily avaliable but smart phones are and in
            today's
            world
            searching a website is faster than flipping through a Bible.</p>
